/**
 * 
 * NAME:		Matthew Hunt
 * PROJECT:		Project 1
 * COURSE:		CS260
 * INSTRUCTOR:	Petruska
 * DUE DATE:	10/08/2016
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION: A Linked List is a sequence of elements arranged,
 * one after another, with each element connected to the next 
 * element by a link.  Placing each element together with the link
 * to the next element results in a component called a Node. 
 * 
 * CLASS METHODS:
 * 		listCopy(Node<T> source)
 * 			Creates and returns a copy of a linked list.
 * 		listPosition(Node<T> head, int position)
 * 			Retrieves a Node at a given position in a
 * 			linked list.
 * 		listLength(Node<T> head)
 * 			Calculates the length of a linked list.
 * 		getTail(Node<T> source)
 * 			Retrieves the tail of a linked list.
 * 
 * CONSTRUCTOR METHODS:
 * 		Node(T initData, Node<T> initLink)
 * 			Constructs a Node and sets the Node's data
 * 			and link with the parameters.
 * 
 * INSTANCE VARIABLES:
 * 		data
 * 			Holds an element of type T.
 * 		link
 * 			Holds another Node.
 * 
 * INSTANCE METHODS:
 *		addNodeAfter(T element)
 *			Adds a new Node after this node.
 *		removeNodeAfter()
 *			Removes the Node that is after this Node.
 * 		toString()
 * 			Returns a string representation of the Node.
 *
