--Isaac Harter's Contributions--
created struct trieNode
created allocNewNode
helped with main()
helped insertLetter()
helped with freeTrieMemory()
did final documentation of code

Isaac put in a lot of his own time, outside of us working together, 
forming the strucuture. I'm not sure on his total hours, but he was
great to work with and we put in an equal amount of effort in the project.
